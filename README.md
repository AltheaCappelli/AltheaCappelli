$\huge{\bf{\color{yellow}{\text{Hello and welcome to my GitHub :) 👋}}}}$  

Here I explore ideas and projects I find interesting, mostly around __machine learning, data visualization and analysis__. With bachelor's and master's degrees in physics, and a strong background in _theoretical physics_, I’m comfortable working with complex data and programming, but I’m still eager to push myself further and learn new things.  
You can check out my projects on [my website](https://altheacappelli.github.io/), and contact me by email at tea.cappelli@gmail.com!
