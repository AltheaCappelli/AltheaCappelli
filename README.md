<h2><b>Hello and welcome to my GitHub :) ðŸ‘‹</b></h2>
Here I explore ideas and projects I find interesting, mostly around <b>machine learning, data visualization and analysis</b>. With bachelor's and master's degrees in physics, and a strong background in <i>theoretical physics</i>, Iâ€™m comfortable working with complex data and programming, but Iâ€™m still eager to push myself further and learn new things.  
You can check out my projects on <a href="https://altheacappelli.github.io/">my website</a>, and contact me by email at <u>tea.cappelli@gmail.com</u> !
